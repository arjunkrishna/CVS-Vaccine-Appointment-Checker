What is this?

Checking CVS' availability for COVID vaccines is a mess.  It currently changes every few minutes, and getting my father-in-law an appointment was difficult.  By the time we saw an availability, it would be gone by the time he got to check it, and checking a list of all available cities that they could reasonably drive to was time-consuming.  With a little bit of scripting, I simplified the process.

Once you fill out the cities you want to check for, the script will email you when a vaccine is available in one of those cities.

The script can be looped a customizable number of times, which is particularly useful if you only want to check a few cities, as you can start the script and walk away.

Please note that this script does not account for anyone's particular eligibility.

How do I use this thing?

1. Go to the Chrome Web Store and install Selenium (current link: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/selenium-ide/mooikfkahbdckldjjndioackbalphokd).
2. Use Selenium IDE to open the file CVS_Covid_Vaccine.side.
3. Edit secondCodedStep.js to include your information (email address and what target cities you want to check).
4. Copy the script into Selenium IDE's second coded step (the "Target" field), then click the play button to run the test.
5. If you want the script to run more than once, uncomment the "times" and "end" lines of the Selenium project, and set the number of times you want it to run.
